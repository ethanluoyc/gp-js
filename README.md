## Gaussian process regression demo in Javascript

This repository contains code for a Gaussian process regression demonstration in Javascript. It is forked from https://github.com/to-mi/gp-demo-js, but I have made significant 
modifications to the codebase to adapt to my needs.

## Installation

We use webpack to build (`npm install && npm run build`), the resulting js files resides in dist/js. You can use `npm run serve` to open up a server to see the demo page.
